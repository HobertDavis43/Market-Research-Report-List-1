<p><h1>Scroll and Absorption Chillers Market Share & Market New Trends Analysis Report By Type, By Application, By End-use, By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Scroll and Absorption Chillers Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Scroll and absorption chillers are two distinct types of cooling systems used in various applications, including commercial and industrial settings. Scroll chillers utilize a set of scrolls to compress refrigerant efficiently, offering high reliability and low maintenance. They are known for their energy efficiency and quieter operation, making them ideal for buildings where noise reduction is a priority. Absorption chillers, on the other hand, use heat, rather than electricity, to drive the cooling process, making them suitable for applications that can utilize waste heat or hot water. </p><p>The Scroll and Absorption Chillers Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.9% during the forecast period. This growth is driven by rising energy demands, the increasing focus on energy-efficient technologies, and stringent environmental regulations promoting the use of eco-friendly cooling solutions. Furthermore, advancements in chiller technologies, including improved designs and hybrid systems, are driving market expansion. The increasing adoption of chillers in regions with hot climates, coupled with the ongoing shift towards sustainable and renewable energy sources, also contributes to market growth. As industries continue to seek efficient cooling solutions, the demand for both scroll and absorption chillers is poised for significant advancements.</p></p>

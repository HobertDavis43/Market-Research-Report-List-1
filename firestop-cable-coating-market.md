<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Firestop Cable Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IntumescentCableCoatings</li><li>Non-IntumescentCableCoatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The firestop cable coating market is primarily divided into two types: intumescent and non-intumescent cable coatings. Intumescent cable coatings swell when exposed to heat, creating a protective layer that insulates cables from fire and helps prevent the spread of flames. Non-intumescent coatings, on the other hand, do not expand but focus on enhancing the thermal resistance of cables and providing a durable barrier against flames and heat. Both types are essential for ensuring fire safety in various electrical installations.</p></p>

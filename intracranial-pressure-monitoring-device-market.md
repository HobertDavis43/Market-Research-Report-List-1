<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Pressure Monitoring Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Intracranial Pressure Monitoring Device</li><li>Noninvasive Intracranial Pressure Monitoring Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intracranial pressure monitoring device market is divided into two primary types: invasive and noninvasive devices. Invasive intracranial pressure monitoring devices involve the placement of sensors directly into the cranial cavity, providing accurate and immediate pressure measurements, typically used in critical care settings or during neurosurgery. Noninvasive intracranial pressure monitoring devices, on the other hand, measure pressure indirectly through external sensors, offering a safer alternative for patients, particularly for routine assessments and monitoring in less acute situations.</p></p>

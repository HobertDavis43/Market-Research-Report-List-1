<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coronary Stent Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare Metal Stents</li><li>Drug-Eluting Stents</li><li>Fully Bio-Absorbable Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The coronary stent systems market encompasses three primary types: Bare Metal Stents (BMS), Drug-Eluting Stents (DES), and Fully Bio-Absorbable Stents (BAS). Bare Metal Stents provide structural support but may require further interventions due to restenosis. Drug-Eluting Stents are coated with medication to prevent blockage, significantly reducing the risk of restenosis. Fully Bio-Absorbable Stents, made from biodegradable materials, gradually dissolve over time, aiming to restore natural vessel functionality without leaving permanent implants, thus representing an innovative approach to coronary intervention.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gonorrhea Therapeutics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monotherapy</li><li>Dual Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Gonorrhea therapeutics market is divided into two main treatment types: monotherapy and dual therapy. Monotherapy involves using a single antibiotic to address the infection, which is often effective but may face challenges due to rising drug resistance. Dual therapy combines two different antibiotics to enhance efficacy and reduce resistance development, thereby offering a more robust treatment option. Both approaches are critical in managing gonorrhea effectively, balancing treatment efficacy with the need to combat resistant strains.</p></p>

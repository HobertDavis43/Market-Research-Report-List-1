<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Combustible Ice Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ocean Generation</li><li>Continent Generation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The combustible ice market can be categorized into two primary types: ocean generation and continent generation. Ocean generation refers to methane hydrate deposits found beneath ocean floors, often in deep-sea environments. This type is characterized by larger, extensive reserves, making it a potential target for offshore extraction technologies. Continent generation, on the other hand, involves methane hydrates located within continental margins and permafrost regions. These deposits are typically shallower and more accessible, making them suitable for onshore extraction and exploitation.</p></p>

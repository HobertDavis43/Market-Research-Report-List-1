<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non invasive Ventilation Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CPAP Ventilation Machine</li><li>BiPAP Ventilation Machine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The non-invasive ventilation machine market primarily consists of CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) and BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) machines. CPAP machines deliver a steady flow of air to keep airways open during sleep, commonly used for conditions like obstructive sleep apnea. In contrast, BiPAP machines provide two levels of pressure: higher during inhalation and lower during exhalation, making them ideal for patients with more complex respiratory issues, including COPD. Both devices enhance patient comfort and improve respiratory function without requiring invasive procedures.</p></p>

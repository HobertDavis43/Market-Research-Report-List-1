<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Pump Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs)</li><li>Intra-aortic Balloon Pumps (IABPs)</li><li>Total Artificial Heart (TAH)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heart pump device market includes three main types: Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs), Intra-aortic Balloon Pumps (IABPs), and Total Artificial Heart (TAH). VADs are mechanical devices that help pump blood for patients with weakened hearts, often used as a bridge to transplant. IABPs support heart function by inflating and deflating within the aorta to improve cardiac output. TAHs are complete artificial replacements for the heart, used in end-stage heart failure cases, providing a temporary or permanent solution.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Prefilters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grid or Screen</li><li>Spongy Looking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air prefilters are crucial components in air filtration systems, categorized primarily into two types: grid or screen prefilters and spongy-looking prefilters. Grid or screen prefilters use a rigid structure to capture larger particles and protect the main filter from clogging, ensuring longer filter life. In contrast, spongy-looking prefilters feature a soft, porous structure designed to trap finer dust and allergens while allowing for high airflow. Both types play essential roles in maintaining air quality and efficiency in HVAC systems.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Onshore Wind Turbines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine</li><li>Vertical Axis Wind Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The onshore wind turbine market primarily features two types: Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT) and Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT). HAWTs are the most common, characterized by their blades rotating around a horizontal axis, typically mounted on tall towers to capture wind efficiently. VAWTs, on the other hand, have blades that spin around a vertical axis, offering advantages in turbulent wind conditions and lower heights. Both types cater to varying energy needs and environmental conditions in the renewable energy landscape.</p></p>
